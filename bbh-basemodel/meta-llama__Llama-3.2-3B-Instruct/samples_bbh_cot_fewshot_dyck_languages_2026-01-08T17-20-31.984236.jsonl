Now, let's move to the next part: { < ( { [ < > ] [ ( ) < ( ) > { < ( ( ( ) ) ) > [ ] } ] < > ( < { } > ) }\n   - The sequence { < ( is closed.\n   - The sequence { [ < > ] [ ( ) < ( ) > { < ( ( ( ) ) ) > [ ] } ] is closed.\n   - The sequence < > is closed.\n   - The sequence ( < { } > ) is closed.\n\n5. The entire sequence is now correctly closed: { { { < > } } < > < { { ( ) } } > { } } { < ( { [ < > ] [ ( ) < ( ) > { < ( ( ( ) ) ) > [ ] } ] < > ( < { } > ) }.\n\nThe final answer is: { { { < > } } < > < { { ( ) } } > { } } { < ( { [ < > ] [ ( ) < ( ) > { < ( ( ( ) ) ) > [ ] } ] < > ( < { } > ) }"]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "filter": "get-answer", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "17f79682c96416551c05d25c501e829e3013117a8a2c08fa138ee3149e9ea878", "prompt_hash": "e144b6269701691820e85703a57e0afbd3c8b7709543d646d16c813bf1b68735", "target_hash": "7ce7dbc99071813320e9035596092533178adca243b6e27aa6348c6effa838fd", "exact_match": 0.0}
