The white book is to the left of the gray book.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the order of the books is: red,?, gray.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know the order of the books is: white, gray, red.\n\nNow, let's compare the two orders. We know the red book is the second from the left in both orders. This means the first book in both orders must be the same (the white book). \n\nSo, the correct order is: white, red, gray.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) The red book is the rightmost: This is incorrect, as the red book is the second from the left.\n(B) The gray book is the rightmost: This is incorrect, as the gray book is the third from the left.\n(C) The white book is the rightmost: This is incorrect, as the white book is the first from the left.\n\nHowever, we can deduce that the correct order is white, red, gray. Since the white book is the first from the left, it must be the leftmost. The red book is the second from the left, and the gray book is the third from the left. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options A, B, or C.\n\nHowever, if we re-examine the options, we can see that option (A) is actually the opposite of what we deduced. The red book is not the rightmost, but rather the second from the left. So, the correct answer is actually the opposite of option (A)."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "filter": "get-answer", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "c91b5e2e6f9b1177662f112098b7fe68efb55489542004b0daa903eaed40510c", "prompt_hash": "6f01bb8c9772581afa36acbae3ff9a964adbda753c25943a823b74fa493e3198", "target_hash": "79398e2d8cadfc05f0152f92591166a1f81ebeeb0156179ef1a0f6c55ebc9af9", "exact_match": 0.0}
