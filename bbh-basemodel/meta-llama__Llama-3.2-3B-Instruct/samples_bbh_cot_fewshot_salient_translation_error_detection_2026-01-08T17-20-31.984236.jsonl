The source sentence mentions \"Mumienumhüllung,\" which refers to the wrapping of mummies. \n2. The translation translates it to \"mummy wrapping,\" which is a correct translation of the term.\n3. However, the translation then says \"on wooden panels in Egypt,\" which is incorrect. The source sentence does not mention \"wooden panels\" but rather \"Holztafeln,\" which means wooden panels. The translation should be \"on wooden panels\" instead of \"in Egypt.\"\n4. The translation also says \"or painted less often on the wrappings of mummies,\" which is a correct translation of the phrase \"seltener auf die Umhüllungen von Mumien gemalt wurden.\"\n\nConsidering the above points, the error in the translation is related to the placement of the modifier \"in Egypt\" instead of \"on wooden panels.\" This is an example of a modifier or adjective being misplaced.\n\nThe correct translation should be: Mummy portrait is the ancient name for portraits wrapped on wooden panels in Egypt or painted less often on the wrappings of mummies.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) Modifiers or Adjectives."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "filter": "get-answer", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "3fe042c825b206e68b2b8126b2d145b8a0f302609501a96face00a69425d1496", "prompt_hash": "cd73b10c38d5129fde44bb384155d0ae4efef142fff98534778848f510baaff2", "target_hash": "ab0531c9d89473e8c5af60d4621a5d5bfaa6a5b1f1ebf3cc69e20814fee801cc", "exact_match": 0.0}
