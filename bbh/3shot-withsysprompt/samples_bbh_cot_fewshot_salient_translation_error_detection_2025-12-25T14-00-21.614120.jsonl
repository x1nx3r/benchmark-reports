Potsdamer Platz is a square-like hub in the Berlin districts of Mitte and Tiergarten in the Mitte district between the old city centre in the east and the new west of Berlin.\"\n\nHere are key differences:\n1. \"square-shaped\" vs. \"square-like\": The original uses \"platzartiger\", which means \"square-shaped\" or \"square-artistic\". This implies the Potsdamer Platz is shaped like a square. The translation changes it to \"square-like\", which is more colloquial but doesn't convey the same precision as the original. Therefore, the translation contains a modifier error because it altered the precise description of the shape using \"platzartiger\".\n2. \"transportation hub\" vs. \"hub\": Both terms are used here, but the original describes the place as a \"platzartiger Verkehrsknotenpunkt\", emphasizing its square shape as a hub for traffic. The translation simplifies it to just \"hub\", losing the specific reference to its square shape.\n3. \"western part\" vs. \"west\": The original mentions \"neuer Berliner Westen\", which refers to the \"new Western part of Berlin\". The translation drops \"Western part\" and replaces \"West\" with \"new west\", altering the exact wording.\n\nThus, the translation contains errors related to modifiers/adjectives (A), numerical values (B), dropped content (E), and facts (F). But since the primary issue is the alteration of the precise shape descriptor (\"platzartiger\") to a more general term (\"square-like\"), and also omitting the \"new Western part\" phrase, we need to pick the most fitting option.

The original sentence uses \"spanischer\" which means 'Spanish', but the translation uses 'Spanish' instead. Both are acceptable but \"spanischer\" might imply nationality as a whole, whereas \"Spanish\" refers specifically to language. But since both are used here, it doesn't constitute a modification. Next, check for numerical values. There are no numbers here. Then, check for negation/antonyms. The original sentence starts with \"ist\", which is the third-person singular present tense of \"sein\" (\"to be\"), indicating that he is a politician. The translation uses \"is\", which also indicates the same thing. However, the original sentence uses \"der Partido Popular\", while the translation uses \"of the Popular Party\". This could potentially be a dropped content error because \"der Partido Popular\" is the official name of the party, while \"Popular Party\" is a common name. The translation drops \"Partido\" (meaning \"party\") to make the phrase more concise. Therefore, the translation contains an error pertaining to Dropped Content.

Also, the elevation is given in meters (\"m Höhe\") instead of feet (\"ft\"). Moreover, the translation uses the plural form \"Municipality\" instead of \"Prättigau\" (which refers to a municipality in the context). Also, the word \"as\" is missing after \"designed as a hillside settlement\".\n\nSo, here we have two errors: \n1. The use of \"Village\" instead of \"village\" (correctly capitalized as it's a proper noun). This is a modifier error. \n2. The conversion of the elevation unit from meters to feet, and the omission of the unit \"meters\" for elevation. This is a numerical value error. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the source contains the following error: Named Entities. But in the source sentence, the entities are names (e.g., Schuders), places (e.g., Prättigau), locations, etc. The error in the translation is related to modifiers/adjectives (the translation uses \"Village\" instead of \"village\"), and numerical values (the elevation is converted incorrectly).

But the key point here is the word order. The original sentence uses the word \"enthält\", which means \"includes\" or \"contains\". However, in English, it would be better to use \"includes\" instead of \"contains\", as \"contains\" can imply something else. Also, note that the term \"technische Denkmale\" translates to \"technical monuments,\" and \"Landkreis\" translates to \"state\" (not \"land\"). Therefore, the translation should have used \"technical monuments in the state of Görlitz\" instead of just \"the technical monuments in the state of Görlitz\". Because the original sentence is referring to a specific list of technical monuments in the state of Görlitz. If we omit \"in the state of Görlitz\", then the translation becomes ambiguous. For example, if someone asks for the list of technical monuments in Görlitz, they might expect that the list includes those in the entire state of Görlitz, but the original sentence only lists them in the same state. So the translation omits the phrase \"in the state of Görlitz\", leading to dropped content.

The source mentions \"Die Dorfkirche\", which means the village church. The translation says \"the village church\" but uses the word \"church\" as an adjective instead of the proper noun \"Dorfkirche\". Also, the address mentioned in the source is \"Berlin Strasse 40\", but the translation uses \"Berliner Straße\" without capitalizing it. Since both of these changes alter the entities, we need to check if they involve a change to a different entity. The original source has \"Dorfkirche\", but the translation refers to it simply as \"church\", changing the name. Also, the address is incorrect because \"Strasse\" is written as \"Street\" in English, and \"Berlin Strasse\" should be \"Berlin Street\". Therefore, the translation contains two errors: Named Entity and Dropped Content. The first involves changing an entity to a different form (\"Dorfkirche\" vs \"church\"), and the second involves removing a significant clause regarding the address. So the answer is (D) for Named Entities and (E) for Dropped Content. \n\nWait, but according to the options, which ones can we choose? Both (D) and (E) are possible answers. But the problem states that the error is one of the given options. Looking at the options again, (D) is for Named Entities, and (E) is for Dropped Content. The translation contains an error in Named Entities (changing the entity to \"church\") and also removes a significant clause (address) related to Dropped Content. So the correct answer would be (D) and (E). But the options only allow one choice. We can't pick both. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the source sentence: \"Die Dorfkirche in Hohen Neuendorf befindet sich in der Berliner Straße 40 und ist ein Kirchengebäude der Evangelischen Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg.\"\n\nThe translation says: \"The village church in Hohen Neuendorf is located at 40 Berliner Straße and is a church building.\"\n\nHere, the source mentions \"Dorfkirche\" (village church), but the translation refers to it simply as \"church\". So that's a Named Entity error. Then, the source addresses the building as \"Berlin Strasse 40\", but the translation writes it as \"Berliner Straße\". So that's another error. The source mentions the building's location and its affiliation, which are dropped in the translation. So the translation contains an error pertaining to Named Entities (change of entity) and Dropped Content (removal of a significant clause). \n\nSo the answer is (D) and (E). But according to the options, only one choice is allowed. Maybe I'm wrong, and perhaps the error is more related to Named Entities than Dropped Content. Let me check again.\n\nThe source mentions \"Dorfkirche\", which is a specific entity. The translation says \"church\", which is a general term. So that's a Named Entity error. Then, the source mentions the address as \"Berlin Strasse 40\", but the translation uses \"Berliner Straße\". So that's another error. The translation drops the information about the address being part of the city's name (\"Berlin\"). So the error is related to Named Entities (change of entity) and Dropped Content (removal of a significant clause). \n\nBut since the options include both (D) and (E), maybe the problem allows multiple choices. Wait, no. The problem says \"that error will be one of the following types:\", implying that each option is a separate possibility. So the user is supposed to select one option. Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the source sentence: \"Die Dorfkirche in Hohen Neuendorf befindet sich in der Berliner Straße 40 und ist ein Kirchengebäude der Evangelischen Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg.\"\n\nThe translation is: \"The village church in Hohen Neuendorf is located at 40 Berliner Straße and is a church building.\"\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. \"Die Dorfkirche\" becomes \"the village church\".\n2. \"in der Berliner Straße 40\" becomes \"located at 40 Berliner Straße\".\n\nBoth changes are errors involving Named Entities. The original entity is \"Dorfkirche\", but the translation refers to it as \"church\", which is a different entity.

But let's look closer: The original sentence uses \"Gemeinde\" which means a municipality. Then it specifies \"im Landkreis Göppingen\", but \"in the district of Göppingen\" would require specifying the region as \"Baden-Württemberg\", since \"Landkreis\" refers to a county in Germany. Therefore, the translation did not add any new information, just clarified the region. Hence, there is no dropped content. Also, no numerical value changes here. The name \"Adelberg\" itself isn't changed. Similarly, no modifier or adjective changes here. No negations either. Therefore, the only possible error is that the translation lacks information regarding the specific region, but according to the options given, none of them apply. Wait, maybe there's another point? The original sentence states \"Gemeinde im Landkreis Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg\", whereas the translation is \"municipality in the district of Baden-Württemberg, Germany\". However, the original sentence does include the region (\"in Baden-Württemberg\"), whereas the translation omits it. But according to the options, the error must pertain to one of the categories listed. Since the translation omits the region, perhaps the answer is Dropped Content, but the options don't explicitly mention omitting information. Wait, the options say \"A significant clause in the translation is removed\", so if the translation doesn't include the region, that's missing, hence dropped content. Alternatively, maybe the translation includes \"Germany\", which wasn't present in the original. Hmm. Let me check again. The original sentence is \"Adelberg ist eine Gemeinde im Landkreis Göppingen in Baden-Württemberg.\" The translation is \"Adelberg is a municipality in the district of Baden-Württemberg, Germany.\" The translation adds \"Germany\", which wasn't part of the original sentence.

But the translation says it's the \"ancient name,\" which changes the meaning from a modern term to an older one. Also, note that the original uses \"Porträts\", while the translation uses \"portraits\". Both terms refer to images of deceased people, but the word choice differs. Since the translation switched from \"modern term\" to \"ancient name\", introducing a new concept (the original referred to modern usage, whereas the translation introduced an older concept as if it were still being used today). Therefore, the translation contains an error pertaining to Negation or Antonyms, because it switches from the present tense of modern usage (\"ist die moderne Bezeichnung\") to past tense (\"ist der alte Name\"). This negates the original meaning, making it an error related to changing comparatives to their antonyms.
