The Stanley Cup is awarded to the NHL champion, which happens after the playoffs. Power plays occur during regular season games. So scoring on the power play in the Stanley Cup would be possible. However, since it's the Stanley Cup Final (which is the last playoff game), power plays aren't used. But if he scored in that final game, then yes. But considering the context—power play usually refers to during regular season, but the sentence could still make sense depending on interpretation. However, the typical context for \"power play\" is during regular season. So assuming the sentence is referring to a regular season game (like playoffs), the answer is yes. \n\nWait, but the Stanley Cup Final is the last playoff series. During the finals, they don't use power plays anymore. So the sentence might be confusing because power plays typically happen during regular season. So maybe the answer is yes, but only if it's intended as a regular season power play. If it's meant to be during the Stanley Cup Final, which doesn't have power plays, then the answer is no. Since the original question says \"Stanley Cup,\" I should check if there's any rule about power plays in the Stanley Cup Final. According to NHL rules, power plays do not exist in the Stanley Cup Final. So the correct answer would depend on the context. But generally, unless specified otherwise, the answer would lean towards yes because the original statement doesn't mention the Stanley Cup Final. But if someone knew the specific rules about power plays, they'd need to know. \n\nAlternatively, if the Stanley Cup Final is considered a playoff game, then power plays would not apply. Therefore, the sentence would be incorrect. So the answer is no. \n\nSo the correct answer depends on whether the sentence is referring to a regular season power play or a playoff game. If it's a regular season game, yes; otherwise, no. Wait, the original sentence says \"the Stanley Cup.\" Which is the championship trophy.

Catching a pass typically involves receiving it with one hand, but catching a fade route requires using both hands. The term \"back shoulder\" might refer to the receiver's positioning relative to the defender, but it's unclear if that's a standard play call. In the NFL, receivers often run fades (routes where they face the defender head-on) and use their body to shield them. However, I couldn't find any common terminology like \"back shoulder fade.\" But since Joe Burrow is known for throwing fades, perhaps the sentence is plausible depending on how the term \"fade\" is defined. Alternatively, maybe \"fade\" here refers to a different type of route. Without more context, the answer leans towards yes because Joe Burrow has thrown fades in games.

But the original statement says he scored an easy layup. Maybe the author meant 'goal', which is more common in soccer. So the sentence is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe he did play basketball, hence the layup. But based on my knowledge, he's a soccer player, not a basketball one.
