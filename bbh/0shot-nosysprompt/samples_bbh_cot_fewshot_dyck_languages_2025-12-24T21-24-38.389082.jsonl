The input is a list of strings, and we need to process each string as a Dyck-n word.\nStep 2: For each string, we need to check if it is a valid Dyck-n word. A valid Dyck-n word is a string that starts with an opening parenthesis and ends with a closing parenthesis. The parentheses must be properly nested, meaning that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and vice versa.\nStep 3: To check if a string is valid, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through each character in the string. If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no corresponding opening parenthesis, so the string is invalid. Otherwise, we pop the opening parenthesis from the stack.\nStep 4: After processing all characters in the string, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that all opening parentheses have been properly closed, so the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.\nStep 5: Once we have processed all strings in the input list, we can construct the completed sequence by concatenating the valid strings in the correct order.\nStep 6: Let's apply the above steps to the input list.\nStep 7: The input list is [ < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) < { < > } > [ ] > ] < ( ) > ( ( ( ) ) ) ( < > ) ].\nStep 8: Let's process each string in the input list.\nStep 9: The first string is < [ ] ( ) ( ( { { } } ) ) ).

The input is ( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > ). After removing the whitespace, the string becomes ( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > ).\nStep 2: Next, we need to check if the string is a valid Dyck-n word. A Dyck-n word is a string that consists of n pairs of parentheses, where each pair is properly closed. The input string has 8 pairs of parentheses. We need to check if the string is a valid Dyck-n word with n=8.\nStep 3: To check if the string is a valid Dyck-n word, we can use a stack-based approach. We can iterate through the string and push each opening parenthesis onto a stack. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no matching opening parenthesis for the closing parenthesis, so the string is not a valid Dyck-n word.\nStep 4: Let's iterate through the input string and check if it is a valid Dyck-n word.\nStep 5: The input string is ( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > ). Let's iterate through the string and check if it is a valid Dyck-n word.\nStep 6: The first character is (, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 7: The second character is {, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 8: The third character is }, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has two elements: ( and {. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the elements from the stack.\nStep 9: The fourth character is <, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 10: The fifth character is >, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has one element: <. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the element from the stack.\nStep 11: The sixth character is {, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 12: The seventh character is <, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 13: The eighth character is }, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has two elements: ( and <. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the elements from the stack.\nStep 14: The ninth character is {, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 15: The tenth character is <, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 16: The eleventh character is (, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 17: The twelfth character is <, which is an opening parenthesis. Push it onto the stack.\nStep 18: The thirteenth character is >, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has three elements: (, <, and <. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the elements from the stack.\nStep 19: The fourteenth character is ), which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has two elements: ( and <. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the elements from the stack.\nStep 20: The fifteenth character is }, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack has one element: <. Since the stack is not empty, the closing parenthesis is matched. Pop the element from the stack.\nStep 21: The sixteenth character is >, which is a closing parenthesis. Check if the stack is empty. The stack is empty. Since the stack is empty, the closing parenthesis is unmatched. The string is not a valid Dyck-n word.\nStep 22: Therefore, the input string is not a valid Dyck-n word. The correct output should be \"Invalid Dyck-n word\".\nStep 23: The input string is ( { } < > { < { ( < > ) } > ). The correct output is \"Invalid Dyck-n word\".\nStep 24: The input string is not a valid Dyck-n word. The correct output is \"Invalid Dyck-n word\".\nStep 25: The input string is not a valid Dyck-n word. The correct output is \"Invalid Dyck-n word\".\nStep 26: The input string is not a valid Dyck-n word.
