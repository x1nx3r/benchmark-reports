The task is to identify the type of error in the translation.\nStep 2:  The first step is to compare the source sentence with the translation to identify any discrepancies.\nStep 3:  The source sentence states that the Banque d'Athénes was a commercial bank based in Athens, Greece, founded in 1893, and was taken over by the National Bank of Greece until 1962.\nStep 4:  The translation, however, changes the founding year to 1993 and the takeover period to 1962.\nStep 5:  The error here is in the numerical values. The original founding year is 1893, but the translation incorrectly states it as 1993. Similarly, the takeover period is 1962, but the translation incorrectly states it as 1993.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the error is in the numerical values, which is option (B).\nStep 7:  Hence, the correct answer is (B) Numerical Values.\n\nThe best answer is B."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "filter": "get-answer", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "6e6f179448059c5032802e1506f3a9791e1c4ac9c86b3db55d1cfac126ef8954", "prompt_hash": "233507634ff2dd9a33febddd29d6ba5575243460f124c3ff6f952ff522cb2b62", "target_hash": "79398e2d8cadfc05f0152f92591166a1f81ebeeb0156179ef1a0f6c55ebc9af9", "exact_match": 0.0}
