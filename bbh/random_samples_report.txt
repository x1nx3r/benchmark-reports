Given the context that Jane was born on the last day of February (February 29th, 2000), and today she is 16 years old, we can infer her age progression as follows:

1. **Current Age**: 16 years old (as of today)
2. **Previous Birthday**: Her 15th birthday would have occurred on February 29th, 2015.
3. **Date One Year Ago**: To find the date one year ago from today, we subtract 1 year from today's date (February 29th, 2016).

The calculation is straightforward:

**2016 - 1 = 2015**

Thus, one year ago from today (February 29th, 2016), the date would be **February 29th, 2015**.

The antecedent of the pronoun "his secretary" is unclear because the sentence structure does not explicitly link the secretary to "they." The original sentence states, "My parent called his secretary for more information," where "his secretary" likely refers to the secretary employed by "his" (presumably the speaker's parent) rather than an external entity. However, without explicit context, such as whether "his secretary" is referring to someone else or the same person, the pronoun's reference is ambiguous. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.

The antecedent of the pronoun "she" in the sentence "The visitor tells the teacher that she likes the cake" is "the visitor." 

Explanation: 
- The subject of the sentence is "the visitor."
- The pronoun "she" refers back to the subject because the sentence states that "she" likes the cake.
- The context implies that "she" is a female referring to the visitor, making the antecedent clear.

Correct Option: (A) The visitor likes the cake.

Based on the analysis, the best matching option from the given choices would be **(C) Rear Window**. While it differs significantly in genre, "Rear Window" is a classic thriller (1954) directed by Alfred Hitchcock, known for its suspenseful storytelling and voyeuristic themes. Although it lacks the sci-fi or epic elements present in the original list, it shares some elements of psychological tension and suspenseful plots.

error is not listed among the options, but based on the analysis, the best answer would be:

The translation contains an error pertaining to **Negation/Antonyms** (C). The original sentence uses "existiert haben" (past tense, indicating existence in the past), while the translation replaces it with "exist or still exist" (negating existence). The translation's use of "exist or still exist" is an example of introducing a negation, which is the correct answer.

**Answer**: C. Negation or Antonyms.

The error in the translation is that it incorrectly handles named entities. Specifically, the source sentence uses two distinct named entities: "der oberbayerische Gemeinde Übersee" (the Upper Bavarian community Übersee) and "Übersee" (the community name). 

In contrast, the translation combines these into "the Upper Bavarian community mainland," which is an incorrect amalgamation. This results in a loss of specificity regarding the community name, leading to an error in handling named entities.

Then, Alice swaps her book (G) with Bob, who had **The Odyssey** (O). Now, Bob has O and G. After the third swap between Claire and Alice, Claire gives F to Alice, who already has G.
