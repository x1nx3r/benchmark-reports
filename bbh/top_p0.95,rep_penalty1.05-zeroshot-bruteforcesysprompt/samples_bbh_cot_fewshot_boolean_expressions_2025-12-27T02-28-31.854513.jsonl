The operator precedence is as follows:\n- NOT (negation) has the highest precedence.\n- AND and OR have lower precedence, but they don't conflict with each other unless both are present.\n\nBreaking down the expression:\n\n1. **\"not True\"**: Here, \"not\" has the highest precedence. So, this becomes NOT(True) = NOT(1) because in Boolean, True is represented as 1, and False as 0. Therefore, NOT(1) = 0 (since NOT(1) flips the value).\n\n2. **\"or False\"**: Now the expression is: \"0 or False\". In Boolean, the 'or' (OR) operator is short-circuited. When you have an OR operation, if the first operand is 0, the whole expression evaluates to 0 regardless of the second operand. So, here, even though we have \"False\", which would be 0, since the first operand is 0, the entire OR expression is 0.\n\n3. **\"not not True\"**: Again, \"not\" has the highest precedence.

The given expression is: \"not not not False and True or False\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the expression into smaller parts. From left to right, we have:\n\n1. \"not not not False\" - This part involves applying the NOT operator three times to False. \n\n   The NOT operator inverts the truth value. Since False becomes True when inverted once, applying NOT twice would invert it again, resulting in False. Applying NOT three times would invert it once more, returning to the original state. Therefore, \"not not not False\" simplifies to False.\n\n2. So the first part of the expression is False.\n\n3. Then we have \"and True or False\". \n\n   The AND operation requires both operands to be True for the result to be True. However, since the first part (False) is already False, the entire AND operation will evaluate to False regardless of True. \n\n4. Next, we have \"or False\". \n\n   The OR operation requires at least one operand to be True for the result to be True. If the first operand is False, as it is here, then the OR operation depends on the second operand. However, since the first part is False, the overall expression's result will depend solely on the OR operation between False and the second part. But in this case, the first part being False means the entire expression's result will be determined by the OR operation. However, because False and False in an OR operation would require at least one to be True (which is not possible here), the result would be False. But wait, let's check the order of operations carefully.\n\n   The correct order of operations is: first evaluate the NOT tripled part (which is False), then evaluate the AND with True. Since the AND requires both sides to be True (but one side is False), the result is False. Then, the OR with False. Since the entire expression after AND has evaluated to False, the OR with False would make the entire expression False. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let's verify the steps again.\n\n   Breaking down the expression:\n\n   1. \"not not not False\"\n\n      Applying NOT three times:\n      False -> True (first NOT)\n      True -> False (second NOT)\n      False (third NOT)\n\n   2. So the first part is False.\n\n   3. Then \"and True or False\"\n\n      Since the first part is False, the AND operation would require True, which it doesn't have. So the AND operation evaluates to False.\n\n   4.

A Boolean expression is a statement that can be either true (T) or false (F), and it often involves logical operations such as AND (∧), OR (∨), and NOT (¬). The possible outcomes of a Boolean expression depend on its structure.\n\nFor example, if the expression is a simple variable like \"x\", its value is either T or F. If it's an AND operation between two variables, say \"a ∧ b\", then the result is T only if both a and b are T; otherwise, it's F. Similarly, an OR operation \"a ∨ b\" is T if at least one of a or b is T.\n\nThe question \"True or False or not True or False\" seems to be phrased ambiguously. However, assuming it's asking whether the expression is true, false, or neither (not applicable in Boolean logic), we can proceed under the assumption that the expression is being evaluated for its truth value.\n\nGiven that Boolean expressions can have multiple possible values depending on their structure, the evaluation of a random Boolean expression would require either:\n\n1. **Determining the expression's structure**: If the expression is a single variable, it's T/F. For operations involving variables, the result depends on the variables' values.\n2. **Providing sample values**: If the expression is defined with specific inputs, such as variable assignments, we could compute its output.\n\nHowever, without explicit details about the expression (e.g., variables, operators), we can't give a definitive answer. Therefore, the best approach is to provide a general framework for evaluating Boolean expressions.\n\nIn summary, the result of a random Boolean expression depends on its structure, the input values, and the logical operations involved.

We start by evaluating `not True` and `False and True`.\n\n2. **Evaluate \"not True\"**:\n   - In Boolean logic, `True` is represented as 1 and `False` as 0. So, `not True` is equivalent to `not 1`, which simplifies to 0 (since `not 0` is 1).\n\n3. **Evaluate \"False and True\"**:\n   - `False and True` is equivalent to `0 and 1` in numerical terms.

It consists of two main parts: \"True or not False\" and \"(False)\".\n\nStarting with the first part: \"True or not False\". In Boolean logic, \"or\" (often denoted as ∨) is the logical OR operation. The expression can be parsed as follows:\n- \"True\" is a literal value.\n- \"not False\" is evaluated using the NOT operator (∼). The NOT operator flips the truth value of its operand. So, \"not False\" would become \"True\" (since False flipped becomes True).\n- Therefore, \"True or True\" is evaluated as True (∨).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \"(False)\". This is a parenthesized expression containing a single operand, which is False. Parentheses in Boolean expressions do not affect the evaluation order unless there's a higher precedence operator inside. However, since there's no operator between \"and\" and \"(False)\", we assume that \"and\" has lower precedence than parentheses. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as \"True and (False)\".\n\nNext, evaluating \"(False)\" is straightforward; it's simply False.\n\nThen, applying the AND (∧) operation between \"True\" and False. The AND operation requires both operands to be True for the result to be True. Since one operand is True and the other is False, the result is False (∧).\n\nCombining both results: the first part evaluates to True, and the second part evaluates to False.

In Boolean logic, \"not\" is denoted as \"~\" or \"¬\", but since the user provided it as \"not\", I'll assume that's the intended notation. So \"not True\" would be equivalent to ~True.\n\n2. Since True is a boolean value in Python (or most programming languages), ~True would be False because the negation of True is False.\n\n3. Next, we have \"or False\". In Boolean expressions, \"or\" is represented using the logical OR operator, which is typically represented as ||. However, the user didn't specify the operator, so I'll proceed under the assumption that \"or\" is being used as a disjunction. Therefore, \"or False\" would be equivalent to True || False.
