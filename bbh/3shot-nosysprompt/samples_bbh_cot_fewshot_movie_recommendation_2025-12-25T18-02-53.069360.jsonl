However, looking at the remaining choices:\n\nForrest Gump (1994) shares some elements with Raiders of the Lost Ark (e.g., adventurous tone, iconic character), but its genre is more focused on drama/comedy. \n\nThe Proposal (2009) is a romantic comedy, which doesn't align with the other films' genres.\n\nEverything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex  But Were Afraid to Ask (1972) is a comedy about human sexuality, which might not fit the other films' action-adventure themes.\n\nErnest Rides Again (1993) is a light-hearted comedy, which is unrelated to the others.\n\nNone of the provided options (B, D, E) seem suitable based on their genres. Since there's no clear alternative among the options, perhaps the correct choice would be one that matches the closest theme, even if imperfectly. However, considering the options, none perfectly fits, so perhaps the question is flawed, or the intended answer isn't listed here."]], "filtered_resps": ["[invalid]"], "filter": "get-answer", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "41a0be8bdf5652446d0fc0e8c6c6cfd94a9269591729bda7bb8ee25472795529", "prompt_hash": "161b6e86a44b4fe09f00969f2ac137e8a43faa38bf7cfff1b350f5011ee19bdc", "target_hash": "79398e2d8cadfc05f0152f92591166a1f81ebeeb0156179ef1a0f6c55ebc9af9", "exact_match": 0.0}
