However, this seems incorrect because 332*756 should not exceed 256000 (since 256*1000=256,000).\n\nWait a minute... Let me recheck.\n\n332 * 700 = 233400\n332 * 50 = 16600\n332 * 6 = 1992\n\nAdding up: 233400 + 16600 = 250000\n250000 + 1992 = 252292\n\nTherefore, A * B = 252292. \n\nAlternatively, you could do 332*756 directly using calculator or a more efficient method:\n\n332 * 700 = 233400\n332 * 50 = 16600\n332 * 6 = 1992\n\nBut since 756 is close to 750, but actually 756 is 10 less than 760 (which is 750+10). Therefore, 332*750 would be approximately 253000 (as 333*750≈253000). Then, subtracting 332*6=1992 from it gives 253000-1992≈251308.
