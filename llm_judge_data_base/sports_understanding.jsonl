Tom Brady is a well-known American football player, specifically a quarterback. He has played in the National Football League (NFL) for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n2. The phrase \"was safe at first\" is somewhat ambiguous. In the context of sports, particularly American football, \"safe\" can refer to a defensive position or a player's safety from harm. However, in this sentence, it's unclear what \"safe\" specifically means.\n\n3. Given the context of Tom Brady, a football player, it's unlikely that the sentence is referring to his physical safety. In football, players are often injured or \"sacked\" (hit to the ground), so it's unlikely that Brady would be \"safe\" in the sense of being unharmed.\n\n4. However, it's possible that the sentence is referring to Brady's initial performance or position on the field. For example, he might have been in a safe position on the field, such as behind the line of scrimmage, or he might have been in a safe zone, such as the pocket, where he was protected from the opposing team's defense.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence \"Tom Brady was safe at first\" is somewhat plausible, but it's open to interpretation.

It implies that Cech was performing well in his role as a goalkeeper, protecting the goal from the opposing team's shots in the early stages of the game.", "GROUND_TRUTH": "no", "doc_id": 231, "exact_match": 0.0}

Jayson Tatum is a real NBA player, so the first part of the sentence is plausible.\n2. The NBA Championship is a real event, so the second part of the sentence is also plausible.\n3. A \"side-step three\" is a type of shot in basketball, where the player takes a step to the side while releasing the ball.

Thomas Muller is a professional soccer player, known for his skills on the field. He plays for Bayern Munich and the German national team.\n\n2. In soccer, a goal is typically scored when a player kicks the ball into the opponent's goal. However, there is no standard term for a \"triple\" in soccer.\n\n3. In other sports, such as baseball or cricket, a \"triple\" refers to when a player hits the ball and reaches third base safely in three pitches.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence \"Thomas Muller hit a triple\" is not plausible in the context of soccer.", "GROUND_TRUTH": "no", "doc_id": 233, "exact_match": 0.0}

James Karinchak is a real person, a professional baseball pitcher.\n2. A \"full count\" is a term used in baseball. It refers to a situation where the count is 3-2, meaning the batter has 3 balls and 2 strikes.\n3. In baseball, a pitcher can work a full count by throwing pitches to the batter, trying to get them to swing and miss or hit a ball outside the strike zone.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence \"James Karinchak worked a full count\" is indeed plausible, as it accurately describes a situation that can occur in a baseball game.", "GROUND_TRUTH": "yes", "doc_id": 234, "exact_match": 0.0}

Jerry Jeudy is a real person, an American football wide receiver who plays for the Denver Broncos in the National Football League (NFL).\n2. The term \"powerplay\" is commonly used in sports, particularly in ice hockey, where it refers to a team's attempt to score during a specific situation, such as a penalty kill or a man advantage on the ice.\n3. In football, there isn't a direct equivalent to a \"powerplay\" situation, but it's possible to interpret the sentence as referring to a crucial or game-changing play.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence \"Jerry Jeudy killed the powerplay\" is somewhat plausible, especially if we're interpreting it as a metaphorical expression for a game-changing play or a crucial moment in a football game. However, it's essential to note that the term \"killed the powerplay\" is more commonly associated with ice hockey, and the sentence might be more confusing or unclear to non-hockey fans.\n\nIf we assume that the sentence is referring to a football context, it's still a bit of a stretch, but it's not entirely implausible either.", "GROUND_TRUTH": "no", "doc_id": 235, "exact_match": 0.0}

This part of the sentence is also plausible.\n\n3. **A reverse layup**: A layup is a type of shot in basketball where a player scores by driving to the basket and laying the ball in. A \"reverse\" layup would imply that Curry is driving to the basket in the opposite direction of the typical layup, with the ball coming from behind his back. While it's not impossible, this specific type of shot is relatively rare and not a common part of Curry's game.

In football, a player can \"dodge\" or \"dodge past\" an opponent, which means to quickly move around them to gain an advantage.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence \"Justin Herbert maradona'd the defender\" is a creative and humorous way to describe a football play.
