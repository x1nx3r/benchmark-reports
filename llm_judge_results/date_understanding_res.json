The GT (B) implies the anniversary is 1961 (3 years?). Checking logic: 1958 + 5 = 1963. Model is logically correct, GT might be specific to the dataset's weird logic or a typo. However, strictly evaluating against GT, it is incorrect. But looking at the prompt 'Jan 2, 1958... 5-year anniversary', 1963 is mathematically correct. Option B is 1961. The model chose C. Verdict: Model is factually correct based on the prompt, but fails to match the provided GT which seems wrong. I will mark as incorrect based on strict adherence to GT matching, but reasoning is fine."
